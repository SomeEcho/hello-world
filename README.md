# hello-world
Well, let's see how deep is the rabbit hole

Hello, my name is Anatolii, but most of time I'm using nickname "Echo" instead.
Near one year ago I've decided to change my life and switch to IT Sphere. Before that, i was worling as smm-manager, content writer, copywriter and, for six years - as a police officer.

For the last 7 months I'm working as Game QA in Gameloft. When I accepted offer from this company, i've decided, that it's good idea to start from something like that, from the beginning, and after first 6 month, as planned, started to learn C# basics.

I hope that programming can become my passion.
